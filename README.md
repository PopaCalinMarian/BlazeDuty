# BlazeDuty version v0.0.1

Welcome!

This is the first prototype of this project.

BlazeDuty aims to become a management application with the intent of organizing individuals task.

Beside from being a simple to-do list, there is a feature center around "Priority"

Priority is a variable formed on the multiplication of the importance of the task itself and the estimated timed allocated to it: Priority = Importance * Time

The tasks will be sorted based on the values of the priority of each tasks. The lower the priority, higher the rank(yes I inted to form a priority queue)

For the upcoming parts, I will add an efficient sorting method(currently thinking about Binary Insertion Sort), a proper GUI and I will think what kind of database I want to store the data of the tasks.

Thanks for revising!
